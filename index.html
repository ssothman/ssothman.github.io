								<b>I study Active Matter, I am focusing on the characteristics of Active Brownian Particles under the effect of alignment field. We found that the critical point has shifted due to the effect of the alignment field.</b><br>
								We also researched some of the critical exponents and correlation functions, and have found out that it belong to the same exponent family.<br>
								And now we are focusing on the dynamics of ABPs inside complex geometeries such as Y, T, and inverted Y junctions.<br>
								In parallel, I am studying the dynamics and behavior of mixture of ABPs under the effect of an alignment field.
