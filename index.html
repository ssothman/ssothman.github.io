								<b>We use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of an alignment field on the dynamics of active matter and phase separation. We find that the alignment field shifts the critical point of the phase separation, and that the dynamics of the system are significantly affected by the alignment field. Our results provide insight into the behavior of active matter systems and may have implications for the design of new materials and technologies.

								<b>I am currently working on studying the flow of active matter in a confinement. Where I am looking into the global and local flux profile throughout the channel with the velocity and density profile differences as a function of the channel gemoteries.
									<br>
								The system is flexible to allow for the study of different channel geometries, such as a straight channel, a channel with a constriction, and a channel with a bifurcation. The system is also flexible to allow for the study of different active matter models, such as mixture of active matter and passive matter, or a mixture of active matter with different sizes.
